         Most of the code in this intent about working out where to place the selection after the requested Items have been deleted.

         It's a bit involved bc we're attempting copy A's approach in their apps such as Mail. In those the new item selected post
         deletion depends on the direction the user was previously moving their item selections in. e.g. if they were to:
         1) Select the 1st row.
         2) Then the 2nd
         3) And then delete Item in the 2nd row.

         Then after the deletion the row that will normally be selected will be what was originally the 3rd row.

         While if they went in the opposit direction, say from 3rd to 2nd. And then deleted.  The 2nd, the 1st row would be selected.
