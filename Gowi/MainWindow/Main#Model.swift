/**
 ## Main Window Business Logic Intents
 
 This extension contains the "Intent" methods for the Main StateView - these are the business logic
 operations that child views can call to perform actions. Following the MSV architecture pattern,
 these intents bridge between the stateless views and the centralized AppModel.
 
 ### Intent Categories:
 - **Item Management**: Creating, deleting, and manipulating items with undo support
 - **Selection Logic**: Smart selection management that mimics macOS app conventions
 - **Filtering and Search**: Business logic for content filtering and search operations
 
 ### Design Philosophy:
 - All intents are static methods that take dependencies as parameters
 - Each intent accepts an UndoManager for comprehensive undo/redo support
 - Return values suggest UI state updates but don't directly modify view state
 - Complex selection logic mimics Apple's Mail.app behavior for consistency
 
 ### Undo Integration:
 All intents coordinate with SwiftUI's per-window UndoManager to ensure that every
 user action can be undone, maintaining a consistent and predictable user experience.

         Most of the code in this intent about working out where to place the selection after the requested Items have been deleted.

         It's a bit involved bc we're attempting copy A's approach in their apps such as Mail. In those the new item selected post
         deletion depends on the direction the user was previously moving their item selections in. e.g. if they were to:
         1) Select the 1st row.
         2) Then the 2nd
         3) And then delete Item in the 2nd row.

         Then after the deletion the row that will normally be selected will be what was originally the 3rd row.

         While if they went in the opposit direction, say from 3rd to 2nd. And then deleted.  The 2nd, the 1st row would be selected.
