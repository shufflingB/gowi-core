     Handles clearing the undo stack for the Window when the user shifts their work focus

     ## Background

     ### Undoable Work Focus Areas (UWFA)

     For an app to provide a pleasant undo experience, it needs to be able to define a set of  UI controls that are likely to be used as part of particular user Work Focus such that:
        - within the set - the user will expect undo and redo operations to combine in the same stack
        - outside of the set - they will adopt a different different stack.

     This concept is referred to in this app as an  Undoable Work Focus Area (UWFA)

     Examples:
         - Two `TextField`s, one in a content list and the other in a detail displaying the same date,  would ideally (not possible with SwiftUI currently) share the same undo stack
        and therefore be part of the same UWFA.

        - The controls for managing `Items` in the `Waiting` list such as those for  drag and drop rearrangement and the addition of new `Item` might form part of another UWFA.

        - The notes `TextEditor` for an `Item` another.

     Generally the idea with a UWFA is to stop  things like  a user manipulating their `Waiting` list from accidentally undoing one too many times and in the process undoing all of the
     changes they previously made in say the detail notes for the current `Item`  Or worse, to an `Item`'s notes that is no longer visible.

     ### The Issue

     SwiftUI by default provides:
     - An `UndoManager` instance per Window that it integrates into:
         - The app menubar.
         - its `TextEditor` and `TextField` components to enable domain specific text undo capabilities, i.e. when the user undoes a change, it undoes a block of changes,
         and not just individual characters. Where the
             - `TextField` clears its undo stack, i.e. its ability to undo/redo, the moment the user moves their input elsewhere (UWFA == just that `TextField`)
             - `TextEditor` never clears the `UndoManager`even when different instances are editing different data (no UWFA!!!)
         - And It does not provide any specific api for definining  UWFAs .
             - And the `TextEditor` implentation of undo and redo is liable to breaking when there is either:
                 - More than one `TextEditor`rendering different data in a window
                 - A single `TextEditor` rendering the same data in different windows.

     QED; to create an app with a usable undo implementation the app has to provide it's own Undoable Work Focus Area implementation to handle clearing the window undo stacks.

     ## Solution

     1)  The window defines a set of available UWFA in ``UndoWorkFocusArea`` corresponding to one more controls within UI.

     2) The app sets the  `FocusedValue.undoWfa` to the corresponding ``UndoWorkFocusArea``  when the user interacts with those controls.

     4) This component clears the default SwiftUI  per-window `UndoManager` when it detects that the user has either:
        - started working in another window.
        - or when they are working in a different  `undoWfa`.

     ### Why?
     - Similar to the approach adopted by `TextField`
     - App doesn't really need anything more sophisticated (at the moment).
     - Deelivering something more sophisticated, as Xcode does, with the existing api requires a disproportionate amount of additional work work (see https://github.com/shufflingB/swiftui-macos-undoable-texteditor for an example of one way around it)

        // recursively to the pop-up content. So without the hack, everytime we get the pop-up appear
        // or dissaper, the undo stack gets cleared, which given it gets triggered very easily, would
