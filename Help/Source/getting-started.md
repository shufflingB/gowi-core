# Getting Started with Gowi

Welcome to Gowi! This guide will help you get up and running quickly with your new todo application.

## First Launch

When you first open Gowi, you'll see a clean, organized interface:

- **Sidebar** - Contains your lists (All, Waiting, Done)
- **Content Area** - Shows your todos for the selected list
- **Detail Panel** - Displays details for the selected todo
- **Toolbar** - Quick actions and controls

## Creating Your First Todo

1. **Click the "+" button** in the toolbar, or use <kbd>⌘N</kbd>
2. **Type your todo title** directly in the new item
3. **Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>** to confirm

That's it! Your first todo is created and ready.

## Basic Todo Management

### Adding Details
Click on any todo to select it and see its details in the right panel:

- **Title** - The main description of your todo
- **Notes** - Additional details, links, or context
- **Completion Date** - Set when you want to complete this task
- **Status** - Mark as completed with the checkbox

### Organizing with Lists

Gowi automatically organizes your todos into three smart lists:

- **All** - Shows every todo, regardless of status
- **Waiting** - Shows incomplete todos (your active work)
- **Done** - Shows completed todos

Simply check the completion box to move a todo from Waiting to Done.
